  These programs are simple java programs that are meant to test the ability to manipulate the csv file.   
  I work it out in eclipse, there are three versions programs in package csvmanipulate in source folder src.There is also a csvfile.csv in the project root directory that is meant to be tested.  
* csv.java is the first version.This code calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers in csvfile.csv in column 1.  
  
* csv2.java is the second version. This code can calculate the sum of arbitrary number of numbers in column 1.  

* csv3.java is the third version. You can specify the range and number of numbers to be calculated in column 1.
